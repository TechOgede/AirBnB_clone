## Project Description
This project is regarded as the first step towards building a full web applications to which other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration are added to.

Each task is linked and will help to:
- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a simple shell with a specific use-case; which is to manage the objects of our project:
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
### How to start it
The command interpreter can be started with:
`./console.py`
### How to use it
The interpreter can be used both in an interactive and non-interactive mode

For the interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

For the non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
